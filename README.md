# heart_trail

Our project involves creating a heart rate animation that responds to mouse movement in the browser. 
As the mouse moves, hearts of varying colors and sizes will appear on the screen.
By combining these elements, we'll develop an engaging and dynamic animation that captures the user's attention and provides a fun and interactive experience on the webpage.
